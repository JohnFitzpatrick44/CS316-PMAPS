1) Follow PHP server instructions on course website. This should set up a webpage for the beers database. You should be able to view this from a remote host (that is, not your localhost).
2) Copy my-pdo.php to /etc/php/. 
3) Change $PDO_USER to your username.
4) In your php files, use the following code to reference the database as $dbh. 

	<?php
  		try {
    		include("/etc/php/my-pdo.php");
    		$dbh = dbconnect();
  		} catch (PDOException $e) {
    		print "Error connecting to the database: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    		die();
  		}
	?>


For example, you can query the database by writing 
	
	<?php
 		try {
    		$st = $dbh->query('SELECT * FROM Person');
  		} catch (PDOException $e) {
    		print "Database error: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    		die();
  		}
	?>

Your query's results will be stored in $st.
