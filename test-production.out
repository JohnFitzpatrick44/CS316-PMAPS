 Ari                 | There's a false path to the east here. Every time I've ever been at this point, the crew stops to debate which way to go. Scouting a minute down the false path reveals it's not a real path, so it's no big deal. But, the false path is usually muddy, so just keep that mind if it's really cold or a crewling has super-unwaterproofed boots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | tip      | 2014-03-16 00:26:35
 Ari                 | If facilitating solos at Flat Laurel, I think this is without a doubt the best place to set up base camp. You'll know it when you see it. It's huge. Like you can fit a whole Bearmuda triangle in the site. And it's flat. And has a river. And bear hang trees. And good solo sites nearby. There's another good site 2 minutes southeast on the trail, but this one is better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | solos    | 2014-03-16 00:28:26
 Ari                 | In August 2012 and August 2013, there were issues with bees at a point along this trail. I can't say exactly where, but I would guess it was about half way between D Boone and Deep Gap. It was about 6 minutes past (coming from D Boone) a high impact site, and it was right by some steps made from logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | safety   | 2014-03-16 00:37:37

 Ky~e                | There is a natural rockbed waterslide that is just across the street from the Cove gate and no one from the institutional memories of 2013 knew it existed (discovered August 2012, Aisha knows where it is!). From the road, go a few steps down the trail leading to fish hatch and there should be a small side trail leading down to a campsite. Keep following the path through the right side of the campsite going away from the road and you should end up at a river spot with a narrow waterfall rockslide leading into a swimming hole.                                                                                  +| vam      | 2014-03-16 04:30:52

 Vern                | There isn't much to be desired for camping spots around this area. So if crewlings are like yay gap we'll stop there for the night, try to non-directly push them away from that thought. Horse cove gap is about the same as welll                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | campsite | 2014-03-16 10:43:26
 Scott               | Several high impact campsites. Small stream for water.

 Emily Stout         | Due to some unforeseen circumstances, my March 2014 crew was dropped off here. If for some reason you ever hike this trail, pack Chacos or Crocs - we did 8 legit, take-out-your-soles-and-unbuckle-your-pack river crossings in the span of a mile. In other news, though, there's a gorgeous campsite along this ridge. :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | water    | 2014-03-16 14:10:30

 Ari                 | Great VAM. It's right on the trail, but isn't obvious. You need to climb over and onto the other side of the rock. You know you're at the spot I'm talking about because it's two steps before/after the open field on this trail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | vam      | 2014-03-16 17:55:42

You have cross the stream, and then it's obvious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | general  | 2014-03-16 21:20:11
 Lizzie              | Camped in a field at D-Boone in March 2014, thought we'd get in trouble with the ranger but instead he told us we could use the bathrooms in the heated dining hall. He did request that we check in with him in the future if we're planning to camp there for the night. Right now he lives in the camp master round house past the dining hall but is moving into a big house across the river next year, so go knock on his door for future march trips!                                                                                                                                                                         | campsite | 2014-03-16 21:34:23

 Sludwig             | In August 2013 we couldn't find the trailhead for 109 - the trail is there but I don't think it gets much use. Cross the river and bushwhack a bit up the (admittedly quite steep) bank, you'll find 109 running parallel to the river like the NatGeo shows. Enjoy the spider webs!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | tip      | 2014-03-18 01:17:29

 Ari                 | The trailhead here (for trail #113 Green Mountain) is extremely difficult to find. I think it's about 10 feet east of the bridge, but I'm not sure. Also, the trail is entirely on a ridge. And super steep for the first half mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | general  | 2014-03-18 05:23:03
 Ari                 | The climb to the top of the rock formation just to the west of the path here is 30 seconds. It's a VAM that's mildly decent but also has that extra rewarding feeling of finding something off the path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | vam      | 2014-03-18 05:34:58

 Jamie Bando         | This would be a GREAT solo spot. This could be a pick up after solos to replace Mt. Pisgah and Pink Beds for solos. Go past the boggy area, past two small bridges, go up a hill and curve a bit before you get to the key spot. Explore and really go down some of the smaller little unofficial trails that come off the main one. There are great fire rings and large open areas that would work as a base camp and solo site. Not much foot traffic, came on a weekend.                                                                                                                                                         | solos    | 2014-10-15 14:22:59

 Addison Howenstine  | The trails here that we use for the fun run are poorly marked. Basically you just want to take the trail North as much as you can until you get to a road. You *will* get to a road (Road 225) if you never decide to take a trail South. When we did the route this year, the path we took looked nothing like the map and spat us out on the road in a v different location from where we wanted to be. Just take that road all the way East. NEVER. TURN. LEFT.                                                                                                                                                                  +| safety   | 2015-08-27 15:39:39

 George Bernard      | The Bradley creek trail head is kinda hard to find. There's no sign or marker on it.  It's a moderately steep trail coming off the south side of the road. Obvi look at the map  when you're driving there. Its after the marked trail head on the north side of the road, and before the road blockage when you turn the corner. If you make it to some campsites called YG, that means yellow gap (too far). It is NOT through a campsite. Using parking lots to tell distance is ineffective (what even IS a parking lot in pisgah). Use the marked trail head to the north as a signal to slow down the convoy into search mode. | general  | 2015-08-27 22:16:20
 Michael Kim         | There are some really awesome cliff overhangs here right where the trail splits off.

 Ari Novick          | This is a tunnel. I believe tunnels are PWILD black zone. But in the winter the BRP might be closed, so then...it's okay? I don't know.

 Dusty H             | There's good camping down here by the river, but no good places for bear hangs and no good places to cook. Also, it's probably not ok to camp here ever again because of new Pisgah Bear rules, but just in case, keep this in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | campsite | 2016-06-13 23:32:46

                     | You either have to do some minor bushwhacking 200 feet up a hill to find the Art Loeb or (possibly, we didn't do this) walk along the dried up creek until you find the trail. It's hard to spot but look for the creek and the switchback, if you start walking southwest, you've probably gone too far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |          | 
 Jules               | If necessary, the road widens enough along this route that you can set up a tent, although it is hard to put stakes in the ground due to rocks. In 2018, the road was clearly not being used and we did not see any cars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           +| campsite | 2018-03-19 12:17:18

                     | There is also a mysterious trail on both sides of the road here that is well-maintained. With packs on, it probably takes ~30-45 mins from the earlier Art Loeb non-intersection. It is not the Art Loeb. I cannot identify it on the map. It might eventually meet up w the Art Loeb but definitely not for a while. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |          |

 Mackenzie           | This southern trail is actually off of 276 a little ways east of the Big East Fork trailhead/sign. You can't see it from the parking lot, but if you go east on the road and up around the curve you'll see another small parking lot with a very clear trail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | general  | 2018-03-21 14:02:40
 Mackenzie           | In March 2018, the sign for the Devil's Courthouse Connector trail was broken/missing. To find it, look for the intersection of three trails and a broken half-sign at the intersection- that's your connector trail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | general  | 2018-03-21 14:05:26
 Mackenzie           | Cave is approximately here. Look for a steep side-trail on your left and a large waterfall in the distance. Cave is on the spur trail on the way to the waterfall. If not many people around, best to leave the packs at the top of the spur trail if hiking down to see this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | general  | 2018-03-21 14:10:35

 Emily Stout | Due to some unforeseen circumstances, my March 2014 crew was dropped off here. If for some reason you ever hike this trail, pack Chacos or Crocs - we did 8 legit, take-out-your-soles-and-unbuckle-your-pack river crossings in the span of a mile. In other news, though, there's a gorgeous campsite along this ridge. :) | water | 2014-03-16 14:10:30

 Bobby       | Water here ranges from a small brook to nothing, depending on rain fall. If any, it will cross under the Art Loeb near the A-frame turn off closest to Pilot.                                                                                                                                                                | water | 2014-03-16 17:58:03

 Spud        | There's a waterfall accessible from where the road and Art Loeb cross about a two minute walk North East. It was a good place for water August 2013 & 2015 but was dry 2016.                                                                                                                                                 | water | 2016-09-24 11:22:29

 Ari                | There's a false path to the east here. Every time I've ever been at this point, the crew stops to debate which way to go. Scouting a minute down the false path reveals it's not a real path, so it's no big deal. But, the false path is usually muddy, so just keep that mind if it's really cold or a crewling has super-unwaterproofed boots.                                                                                                            | tip      | 2014-03-16 00:26:35
 Ari                | In August 2012 and August 2013, there were issues with bees at a point along this trail. I can't say exactly where, but I would guess it was about half way between D Boone and Deep Gap. It was about 6 minutes past (coming from D Boone) a high impact site, and it was right by some steps made from logs.                                                                                                                                               | safety   | 2014-03-16 00:37:37

                    | I was never clear on whether it was here or a bit up the trail, or if the 'Yellowstone Falls' marker is actually referring to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |          | 
 Ari                | Great VAM. It's right on the trail, but isn't obvious. You need to climb over and onto the other side of the rock. You know you're at the spot I'm talking about because it's two steps before/after the open field on this trail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | vam      | 2014-03-16 17:55:42
 Bobby and Noelle   | Dank-ass (aka good) campsite a couple switchbacks up from Glocester down to your left as you head up to Pilot.

 Bobby              | Water here ranges from a small brook to nothing, depending on rain fall. If any, it will cross under the Art Loeb near the A-frame turn off closest to Pilot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | water    | 2014-03-16 17:58:03

 Bobby              | There is a campsite hidden above/behind a big rock next to the parking lot. It is really only big enough for 4 man tents, so def don't try to tarp there. Also...it is technically illegal since it is in the area bordering the BRP, so don't let rangers see you...                                                                                                                                                                                        | campsite | 2014-03-16 19:04:35

 Unknown            | If you've never seen it, it's not super obvious that there's a body of water and rocks to jump off here.

 Lizzie             | Camped in a field at D-Boone in March 2014, thought we'd get in trouble with the ranger but instead he told us we could use the bathrooms in the heated dining hall. He did request that we check in with him in the future if we're planning to camp there for the night. Right now he lives in the camp master round house past the dining hall but is moving into a big house across the river next year, so go knock on his door for future march trips! | campsite | 2014-03-16 21:34:23

 Emily Stout        | I always forget how steep this climb is until I'm on it and gasping for breath. Beware.

 Ari                | The trailhead here (for trail #113 Green Mountain) is extremely difficult to find. I think it's about 10 feet east of the bridge, but I'm not sure. Also, the trail is entirely on a ridge. And super steep for the first half mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | general  | 2014-03-18 05:23:03
 Ari                | The climb to the top of the rock formation just to the west of the path here is 30 seconds. It's a VAM that's mildly decent but also has that extra rewarding feeling of finding something off the path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | vam      | 2014-03-18 05:34:58

 Dusty H            | There's good camping down here by the river, but no good places for bear hangs and no good places to cook. Also, it's probably not ok to camp here ever again because of new Pisgah Bear rules, but just in case, keep this in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | campsite | 2016-06-13 23:32:46

                    | You either have to do some minor bushwhacking 200 feet up a hill to find the Art Loeb or (possibly, we didn't do this) walk along the dried up creek until you find the trail. It's hard to spot but look for the creek and the switchback, if you start walking southwest, you've probably gone too far.                                                                                                                                                    |          |

 Mackenzie          | This southern trail is actually off of 276 a little ways east of the Big East Fork trailhead/sign. You can't see it from the parking lot, but if you go east on the road and up around the curve you'll see another small parking lot with a very clear trail.                                                                                                                                                                                               | general  | 2018-03-21 14:02:40
 Mackenzie          | In March 2018, the sign for the Devil's Courthouse Connector trail was broken/missing. To find it, look for the intersection of three trails and a broken half-sign at the intersection- that's your connector trail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | general  | 2018-03-21 14:05:26
 Mackenzie          | Cave is approximately here. Look for a steep side-trail on your left and a large waterfall in the distance. Cave is on the spur trail on the way to the waterfall. If not many people around, best to leave the packs at the top of the spur trail if hiking down to see this one.                                                                                                                                                                           | general  | 2018-03-21 14:10:35
 Mackenzie          | Despite these both being named gaps, there is zero camping here. Have to go all the way to Poplar Lick (works in March, not really in August) or Pressley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | general  | 2018-03-21 14:14:06
 Ari                | This is just a test, but fun fact: this used to be a really confusing drop off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | tip      | 2018-04-09 21:49:01
 Caroline Armstrong | Careful here--we took a service road to go around Sassafras Knob but then ended up also passing Deep Gap and Pilot Mtn. Would have liked to go up Pilot Mtn so watch out for this if you decide to take service road by Sassafras Knob                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | tip      | 2018-08-23 10:05:07
