Project WILD Maps Application Members

We have very recently formed our group, so member participation is limited. As of now, all members are working on getting familiar with the previous map application, the database, and brainstorming which features and filters will be added. More specific contributions have been made, specified below.

Jack Fitzpatrick - Had the original idea, and began work on the initial 3 tasks. Acquired the old maps database, covering tasks 3 and 7, although this database will need to be updated to the new schema.

Kyle Harvey - Heading UI and UX design. Focused mainly on task 4, while also considering sample SQL queries for task 5.
