# CS316-PMAPS
A map-based web application for sharing backpacking advice.

No SQL code has yet been written. The compressed file contains the old code for this application, although we are using virtually none of it. We may consult the google map API usage, however.

A warning for opening the zipped file: there are very large images in the directories, so it is a large file, and might take a while to unzip.
