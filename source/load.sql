It''s - sublime. Because it''s one of those places that''s always empty. This trail is rarely taken and somehow seems more ''primordial'' than the others.

Also, we found a crayfish in the top of the falls here, which really makes me wonder. How could it have survived there? These streams filter down from the edge of the BRP. It and its brethren must have been in these hills for thousands or millions of years.
